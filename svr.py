######### FUNCTIONS EXPLAINED with Working : get_data() basically will store the data in the data set into arrays of prices and dates separately. This will further be used to compute the predicted price . The dates are separated by the use of the split function where we search for a - in the dates.. The input here is simply that of the filename that contains the required data.
########## : the predict_data() is majorly the crux and is the part with the SVR. we have gone for testing with the kernels linear , RBF and polynomial and have plottedd out the respective outputs and determined based on the graphs which model fits the data best and used that predicted value. The inputs for this function are the dates array created as a global vriable and filled in the function get_data() along with prices which is the same process as dates. The third input is the date value for which the prediction is to be made.


########### ASSUMPTIONS AND FAILURE CASES : Since this is a very crude and basic approach in this project the focus is to avoid external factors and market impacts that happen such as mergers, acquisitions , new announcements and other external factors that as of now cannot be accounted for or cant be included. 
#It also assumes that the data is available for each day as we do not expect values for stocks to be not available for a day irrespective of the volume sold or bought that day.
#The model also assumes that the data is real and follows the unstructured and unorganized pattern a stock market does or there would be better methods to do the same.
#Weekend model assumption is not taken into account and as of now the value will be shown for the opening value on Sat and Sun as well.
#All the prices have the same unit i.e all are in dollars or rupees and so on without change across the data.
#Date format is as dd-mm-yy with the â€“ and not / or some other value in words.
